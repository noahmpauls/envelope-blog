Dear reader,

This is not a real blog post. This is merely a simulation of one, in an attempt to grant to you, the reader, a glimpse into how a blog post on this site might appear. There are so many different tools at your disposal, but how are you supposed to know how they'll look? The creator of this blog may have saddled you with some awful CSS baggage, leading to everything looking... wonky.

That wouldn't be good at all.

So, peruse this post at your leisure to get a sense of what is available to you, and how it may look when released to the public. Hopefully, it looks alright! Most likely, it will look terrible. In any case, onward!

## Font Styles

### Bold

There are many different styles of fonts. One such style is the **bold** style of font. Bold is used to display emphasis, sometimes for a single word, **or perhaps for an entire phrase** within a sentence. **The way it is used is often inconsistent.** Don't rely on boldness all the time. 

### Italics

Instead, you might end up relying on *italics*. Italics also convey emphasis, *but of a different sort* than bold letters. *Bold letters imply an increase in volume, while italics imply a change in tone.* At least, that's how a inexperienced reader like me sees it.

### Combination

A combination of **bold** and *italic* might be used by someone who ***really demands attention.*** Or they might just want to show a ramp-up in emphasis.

Right?

*Right?*

***RIGHT?!?***

## Links

When you are a link-clicker, you know you're going placed. Take a link to [Hacker News](news.ycombinator.com), for instance. You'll go to a completely new place! Of course, sometimes links will be used to show that people have an [overwhelming](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14248335/please-explain-vims-configuration-directories-hierarchy) [amount](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/102384/using-vims-tabs-like-buffers?rq=1) [of](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74257025/splitting-a-string-into-a-list-of-integers) [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74257019/how-do-i-get-make-a-nav-item-in-a-horizontal-nav-to-show-on-screen-when-it-has-a) [material](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74257016/attrition-rate-calculation-script-in-python) to back them up. This can be either convincing or annoying.

Hey, what about *[font-styled links?](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/)* This seems like a **[dangerous idea](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/backends-overview/).** Who knows what might happen?

## Headers

There have already been a lot of headers used throughout this post. They introduce a new topic with a quick summary of what it will be about in *huuuuuge* letters, so you won't miss it. Let's see what we can do.

### A slightly smaller header

That header is slightly smaller! Nice! I'm just going to put some filler text in here to make this seem interesting. That way there's a bit of space after this header.

### Same size as the last one

Boring. Let's get some even smaller sizes up in here.

#### Tiny header

Woah, that is tiny. Hopefully it's still bigger than this text. Otherwise, it will appear dwarfed, when the whole point of the header is to be bigger and badder than everyone else. It's like the playground bully of the text. Or the police.

##### Really tiny header

Oof. Now that could be microscopic. I though the last header was bad.

##### Another really tiny header

Wow, okay, let's cool it with the tinyness. Can we return back to a larger size please?

### *Back to normal*

Ah, there we go. Except wait, that has some styling applied to it, doesn't it? That's a bit odd.

#### **Revenge of the bold**

Is that a bold header? Aren't headers supposed to be bold anyway?

### [Take Me Away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sweet_Escape_(song))

If you click that header, you will get taken away! Because it's a link. That was a funny joke. *Laugh.*

Hey, what about putting all headers in order of size?

## Heading 2: Super Header

### A simple time for Header 3

#### How 'bout it, Header 4?

##### No more Mr. Nice Header 5

Wow. That's a lot of headers.

## Lists

### Ordered Lists

Sometimes, I just want to put down some things in order. A list of steps for writing this blog, perhaps. How about it?

1. Start by thinking of a topic you want to write about. In this case, I chose to write a whole set of prose about literally *nothing.* How exciting!
2. Begin writing. Lift up your pencil, and write out a bunch of text on your computer screen.
3. Realize that you've made a terrible mistake:

   1. You are literally an idiot. What were you thinking writing on your computer screen?
   2. Don't panic. It will come off.
   3. It's not coming off.
   4. Damn.
4. Continue the creative process by throwing you computer out the window.
5. **You're done!**

That was so fun! Writing lists makes me so excited. But sometimes my excitement has more disorder than order. That's when I reach for my other tool...

### Unordered Lists

Lists without order are like countries without order. They're essentially limitless utopias where everything goes right because there are no taxes levied upon its people! Here are some other similarities:

* They do not have a president.
* They might degrade into flaming piles of waste on the side of the street because there are no public works.
* Of course, there probably aren't streets either, now that I think about it.

  * Public works does include the streets, I suppose. Privatized streets would be rough. Imagine paying a toll just to leave your driveway!
  * I'd probably opt for something like a subscription model. $9.99 a month for the privilege of using my road!
* Wow, this has turned into a weird list.
* Honestly, just ignore everything that's written here. I have no idea what I'm doing.

And those are unordered lists!

## Block Quotes

Block quotes are for when you don't have anything inspired to say yourself, so instead you farm out what you want to say to someone smarter than you.

> The efficacious advantage of posterity manifests in the form of eccentric flibblegabble, a roundabout of which will make any democratically-minded crustacean wince within the confines of his ethereal locale.
>
> Whatever your philosophy, *a slow mind is indicative of a slow vehicle.* Regular oil changes will aid in the quest to become a regular Socrates. **How do you like *them apples*?**

See how much page space that filled? Now imagine just using block quotes for everything. You'd never have to write originally ever again!

> Very smart. Very smart indeed.

## Other Fun Elements

### Images

Before I show you this image, I would like you to first consider how you've read this whole time without interruption. Isn't it incredible how the written medium allows a distraction-free learning experience? I tend to liken it to a meadow, in which the--

And the contents of the title attribute are extracted to create a caption.")

...rude. I was just getting into a good analysis of... something. Ah, whatever. I'm sure it won't happen aga--

![A mailbox in a grassy field.](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1528329140527-75853b1e1650?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=735&q=80 "Woohoo! I'm back, baby, hitting you with another image and a really huge title text to go along with it. This thing is its own little world. I'm all over the place! YOU WILL NEVER STOP ME!!!!!")

Goodness. I hate these stupid images. But hopefully they look nice anyway. They really make me want to write all over my computer and chuck it out the window.

### Horizontal Rules

Instead of headers, one can use a horizontal rule to indicate a break in the content. The break in this case doesn't signal what the new section will be about, only that something new is beginning. One actually has to read the text to find out what's next. We'll go into what the next section is about in the next section.

This section is about nothing at all. Absolutely zap zippity squat. What the heck are you doing still reading this anyway? You must be a complete moron. And you might be made of boron. *Boom.*

## Wrapping Up

That's about it for this test post! No one will ever read this, so I'm shocked at the amount of effort I've put into it. Ideally, everything in it will look perfect to the end of time. But we all know how likely that is, don't we?
