    <h1>Envelope Blog Style Demo</h1>
    <p>See how a full blog post looks!</p>
    <hr>
  </header>
  <p class="align-end"><em>Thursday, January 26, 2023</em></p>
  <p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>This blog post isn't real. I mean, none of this blog is real. Bob the Mailman is an invention of the mind, his blog even more so. His existence (or lack thereof) is a mechanism for enabling you to see what this blog looks like in practice.</p>
<p>So, peruse this post at your leisure to get a sense of what is available to you, and how it may look when released to the public. Hopefully, it looks alright! As long as you're really into mail, like Bob the Mailman is. Or would be, if he existed.</p>
<h2>Font Styles</h2>
<h3>Bold</h3>
<p>There are many different styles of fonts. One such style is the <strong>bold</strong> style of font. Bold is used to display emphasis, sometimes for a single word, <strong>or perhaps for an entire phrase</strong> within a sentence. <strong>The way it is used is often inconsistent.</strong> It can be infuriating to read improperly bolded text.</p>
<h3>Italics</h3>
<p>Instead, you might end up relying on <em>italics</em>. Italics also convey emphasis, <em>but of a different sort</em> than bold letters. <em>Bold letters imply an increase in volume, while italics imply a change in tone.</em> At least, that's how a inexperienced reader like Bob might see it.</p>
<h3>Combination</h3>
<p>A combination of <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> might be used by someone who <em><strong>really demands attention.</strong></em> Or they might just want to show a ramp-up in emphasis.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p><em>Right?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>RIGHT?!?</strong></em></p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>When you are a link-clicker, you know you're going placed. Take a link to <a href="news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, for instance. You'll go to a completely new place! Of course, sometimes links will be used to show that people have an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14248335/please-explain-vims-configuration-directories-hierarchy">overwhelming</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/102384/using-vims-tabs-like-buffers?rq=1">amount</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74257025/splitting-a-string-into-a-list-of-integers">of</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74257019/how-do-i-get-make-a-nav-item-in-a-horizontal-nav-to-show-on-screen-when-it-has-a">source</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74257016/attrition-rate-calculation-script-in-python">material</a> to back them up. This can be either convincing or annoying.</p>
<p>Hey, what about <em><a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/">font-styled links?</a></em> This seems like a <strong><a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/backends-overview/">dangerous idea</a>.</strong> Who knows what might happen?</p>
<h2>Headers</h2>
<p>There have already been a lot of headers used throughout this post. They introduce a new topic with a quick summary of what it will be about in <em>huuuuuge</em> letters, so you won't miss it. Let's see what we can do.</p>
<h3>A slightly smaller header</h3>
<p>That header is slightly smaller! Nice! I'm just going to put some filler text in here to make this seem interesting. That way there's a bit of space after this header.</p>
<h3>Same size as the last one</h3>
<p>Boring. Let's get some even smaller sizes up in here.</p>
<h4>Tiny header</h4>
<p>Woah, that is tiny. Hopefully it's still bigger than this text. Otherwise, it will appear dwarfed, when the whole point of the header is to be bigger and badder than everyone else. It's like the playground bully of the text. Or the police.</p>
<h5>Really tiny header</h5>
<p>Oof. Now that could be microscopic. I though the last header was bad.</p>
<h3><em>Back to normal</em></h3>
<p>Ah, there we go. Except wait, that has some styling applied to it, doesn't it? That's a bit odd.</p>
<h4><strong>Revenge of the bold</strong></h4>
<p>Is that a bold header? Aren't headers supposed to be bold anyway?</p>
<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sweet_Escape_(song)">Take Me Away</a></h3>
<p>If you click that header, you will get taken away! Because it's a link. That was a funny joke. <em>Laugh.</em></p>
<p>Hey, what about putting all headers in order of size?</p>
<h2>Heading 2: Super Header</h2>
<h3>A simple time for Header 3</h3>
<h4>How 'bout it, Header 4?</h4>
<h5>No more Mr. Nice Header 5</h5>
<p>Wow. That's a lot of headers.</p>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
<p>Sometimes, I just want to put down some things in order. A list of steps for writing this blog, perhaps. How about it?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start by thinking of a topic you want to write about. In this case, I chose to write a whole set of prose about literally <em>nothing.</em> How exciting!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin writing. Lift up your pencil, and write out a bunch of text on your computer screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realize that you've made a terrible mistake:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yeah, this is definitely a problem. What were you thinking writing on your computer screen?</li>
<li>Don't panic. It will come off.</li>
<li>It's not coming off.</li>
<li>Oof.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue the creative process by throwing you computer out the window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You're done!</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That was so fun! Writing lists makes me so excited. But sometimes my excitement has more disorder than order. That's when I reach for my other tool...</p>
<h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
<p>Lists without law and order are bound to get into serious trouble. Just look at this one:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'm a list item that likes to litter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Littering's nothing. I sell those illegal fireworks, and I'm not even worry about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh yeah? Well I'm planning to rob a bank. Here are a few of the things I hope to find inside:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those arcade game tickets where you have to have approximately a billion to get one of the really cool prizes so you usually just settle for something lame like a candy bar</li>
<li>A stuffed crust pizza</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I make terrible puns. For instance, have you ever thought about how our sun is always guilty of our-sun?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm planning to murder the pun-making list item above me for the good of all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, unordered lists aren't for the faint of heart.</p>
<h2>Block Quotes</h2>
<p>Block quotes are for when you don't have anything inspired to say yourself, so instead you farm out what you want to say to someone smarter than you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The efficacious advantage of posterity manifests in the form of eccentric flibblegabble, a roundabout of which will make any democratically-minded crustacean wince within the confines of his ethereal locale.</p>
<p>Whether you talk or you grok, <em>there are no shimmies in the quest for statehood.</em> Regular oil changes will aid in the quest to become a regular Socrates. <strong>How do you like <em>them</em> peaches?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>See how much page space that filled? Now imagine just using block quotes for everything. You'd never have to write originally ever again!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very smart. Very smart indeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Other Fun Elements</h2>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>Before I show you this image, I would like you to first consider how you've read this whole time without interruption. Isn't it incredible how the written medium allows a distraction-free learning experience? I tend to liken it to a meadow, in which the--</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526554850534-7c78330d5f90?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1169&amp;q=80" alt="A display of many different envelopes." title="This image is interrupting the flow of what the narrator was saying! And the contents of the title attribute are extracted to create a caption."></p>
<p>...rude. I was just getting into a good analysis of... something. Ah, whatever. I'm sure it won't happen aga--</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1528329140527-75853b1e1650?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=735&amp;q=80" alt="A mailbox in a grassy field." title="Woohoo! I'm back, baby, hitting you with another image and a really huge title text to go along with it. This thing is its own little world. I'm all over the place! YOU WILL NEVER STOP ME!!!!!"></p>
<p>Goodness. These images are really getting on my nerves. But hopefully they look nice anyway. They really make me want to write all over my computer and chuck it out the window.</p>
<h3>Horizontal Rules</h3>
<p>Instead of headers, one can use a horizontal rule to indicate a break in the content. The break in this case doesn't signal what the new section will be about, only that something new is beginning. One actually has to read the text to find out what's next. We'll go into what the next section is about in the next section.</p>
<hr>
<p>This section is about nothing at all. Absolutely zap zippity squat. I'm an absolute anarchist, making you read completely meaningless text like that. I practically belong in an unordered list.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>That's about it for this test post! No one will ever read this, so I'm shocked at the amount of effort I've put into it. Ideally, everything in it will look perfect to the end of time. But we all know how likely that is, don't we?</p>
